# AI-Is-Fun
A project to learn and create AI and ML projects
Written by Naina Singh

This repository is created to learn and practise AI/ML codes and create simple projects.
Since I am a class 12th student and a beginner myself, I will keep it as simple as possible.

It can be a good starting point for students and beginners.
Feel free to let me know your comments and suggestions.
It will help me learn and improve myself.
